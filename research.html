    <h1>Research</h1>
    <p>
      My research is motivated by the sociatal need to understand the <b>physics of interfacial flow in multiphase and complex media</b>. Through a combination of careful experimentation and rigorous analysis, I investigate fundamental problems with broad implications, including industrial processes such as heat and mass transfer, the behavior of natural phenomena, and the design of systems for controlled fluid motion. Within this overarching mission, my current research themes are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Interfacial Dynamics</li>
      <li>Multiphase Transport Phenomena</li>
      <li>Complex Fluids</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Drop–bath impacts</h3>
    <p>We investigate how the surrounding gas influences the impact dynamics of submillimeter drops on a liquid bath. 
      Using a vacuum chamber, we systematically vary the gas type and pressure to examine transitions between coalescence, bouncing, and transient floating. Experimental results are directly compared with a computational model that captures air-layer evolution through a lubrication framework incorporating nanoscale gas kinetic effects and disjoining pressure. </p>

    <h3>Water entry</h3>
    <p>A solid sphere impacting a quiescent bath can form an air cavity whose evolution depends on the impact conditions and sphere wettability. 
      This project investigates how modifying the bath surface, either through active deformation or coating the surface with a secondary medium, affects cavity dynamics and can dramatically alter the physical mechanisms governing cavity closure.</p>

  <div class="project-text">
    <h3>Liquid sheets and bells</h3>
    <p> We study the formation, breakup, and stability of axisymmetric liquid sheets and bell-like structures generated by the impact of a drop or liquid jet on a small target. Our research focuses on how the geometry of the impactor controls the dynamics and stability of the resulting sheet, and how the two-way coupling between fluid ejection and solid shape can be harnessed to manipulate liquid flows and design responsive, force-generating surfaces. </p>

    <h3>Controlling granular interfaces</h3>
    <p>An interface coated with a monolayer of granular particles exhibits a range of useful mechanical properties. In this project, we use a variety of probes to mechanically manipulate the granular interface by imposing local interfacial height gradients. The ability to perforate these interfaces is tested as a new method for modifying local particle concentrations—a potential route for tailoring overall interfacial properties.</p>
