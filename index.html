       Hello, and welcome to my homepage. My research spans fluid mechanics and soft matter physics, with current interests in capillary-scale phenomena, interfacial dynamics, non-Newtonian flows, and granular matter.

      <b><span style="font-size: 1.4em;">About me</span></b><br>
      I earned my B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from Clemson University in 2018 and remained at Clemson for graduate study, completing both my M.S. (2020) and Ph.D. (2024) under the mentorship of <a href="https://cecas.clemson.edu/~jbostwi/">Dr. Joshua Bostwick</a>. My doctoral work explored a range of fluid phenomena and culminated in the dissertation <em>Capillary Phenomena in Flow Down Fibers: Beads, Bridges, Sheets, and Threads</em>. Alongside my research, I served as Chair of the Mechanical Engineering Graduate Student Council, co-hosted the Graduate Research Seminar, and mentored incoming students through the CECAS Peer Mentoring Program.
     </p> 
    <p>
      Following my PhD, I joined the Center for Fluid Mechanics at Brown University as a Hope Street Postdoctoral Fellow, working with <a href="https://sites.brown.edu/harrislab/">Dr. Daniel Harris</a>. My current projects investigate drop-substrate interactions and water entry dynamics, focusing on how non-wetting, deformable, or actively deformed substrates influence these phenomena, as well as how ambient gas conditions affect air-film-mediated processes like drop rebound.
