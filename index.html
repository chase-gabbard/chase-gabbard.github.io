       Hello, and welcome to my research homepage. I study fluid mechanics at the capillary scale, including the behavior of liquid drops and beads, interfacial phenomena, and more broadly, multiphase flows. I’m particularly interested in the fundamental physics that govern how fluids move, interact, and evolve—insights that can help advance technologies for transporting, collecting, and controlling small volumes of liquid in both natural and engineered systems.

      I graduated with my B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from Clemson University in 2018. I continued at Clemson University for my graduate studies, obtaining a Masters (2020) and PhD (2024) degree under the supervision of <a href="https://cecas.clemson.edu/~jbostwi/">Dr. Joshua Bostwick</a>. During graduate school, I studied a range of fluid phenomena that culminated in my dissertation “Capillary Phenomena in Flow Down Fibers: Beads, Bridges, Sheets, and Threads.” In addition to my research efforts, I served as Chair of the Mechanical Engineering Graduate Student Council, co-hosted the Graduate Research Seminar, and mentored incoming graduate students through the CECAS Peer Mentoring Program.
     </p> 
    <p>
      Following my PhD, I joined the Center for Fluid Mechanics at Brown University as a Hope Street Postdoctoral Fellow working with <a href="https://sites.brown.edu/harrislab/">Dr. Daniel Harris</a>. My current projects involve drop-substrate interactions and water entry problems. These projects consider how a non-wetting and deformable, or actively deformed substrate affects these phenomena, as well as how the ambient gas conditions alter air-film mediated phenomena, such as a drop rebounding from a bath.
